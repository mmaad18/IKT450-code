# 2 - Neural Networks

In this task you are supposed to implement 2 types of mulilayer Perceptrons: 
1. Using only Python. 
2. Using a high level library

### Download the Dataset:
- Download the Ecoli dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ecoli 

### Data Preparation:
- Filter the dataset to include only the classes cp and im, and remove the rest of the data.
- Make necessary adjustments to the data to prepare it for the Multilayer Perceptron models.

### Implement the MLP from Scratch:
- Implement a Multilayer Perceptron from scratch using only Python and standard libraries.
- Ensure that your implementation includes the following:
  - Forward propagation to compute the output.
  - Backpropagation to calculate the gradients.
  - Weight update mechanism based on the gradients.
- Note: You do not need to train this model, just ensure the implementation is functional.

### Implement, Train, and Test the MLP using a High-Level Library:
- Implement a Multilayer Perceptron using a high-level library such as PyTorch.
- Train the model on the prepared dataset.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on a test set using appropriate metrics.

### Evaluate the MLP Implementations:
- Compare the performance of the MLP implemented from scratch with the one implemented using the high-level library.
- Discuss the differences in ease of implementation, training time, and performance.

### Choose the network architecture with care.

### Train and validate all algorithms.

### Make the necessary assumptions.
