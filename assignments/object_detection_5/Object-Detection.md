# 5 - Object Detection

In this task you are supposed to implement a more advanced convolutional net using the Balloon dataset. 
The new network should contain one or more of the following:

### Download the Dataset:

- Download the balloons dataset https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases 

### Data Preparation:

- Perform necessary pre-processing steps such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to prepare the dataset for training.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.

### Implement Object Detection Using a Pre-Trained Model:

- Use a pre-trained model such as MaskRCNN to perform instance segmentation on the dataset.
- Start by understanding and adapting the architecture of MaskRCNN or another instance segmentation model.
- Train and fine-tune the model using appropriate hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, 
  and number of epochs, to adjust it to the new dataset.

### Hints:

- You can follow the tutorial https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html 
- You can look at Tensorflow example https://engineering.matterport.com/splash-of-color-instance-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-and-tensorflow-7c761e238b46 

### Choose the network architecture with care.

### Train and validate all algorithms.

### Make the necessary assumptions.
