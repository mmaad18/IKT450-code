# 5 - Object Detection

In this task you are supposed to implement a more advanced convolutional net using the same dataset as last week. 
The new network should contain one or more of the following:

- Download the balloons dataset https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases 
- Use a pretrained model (e.g., MaskRCNN) to do instance segmentation and automatically color in balloons
- Hint: You can follow the tutorial https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html 
- Hint 2: Look at Tensorflow example https://engineering.matterport.com/splash-of-color-instance-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-and-tensorflow-7c761e238b46 
- Choose the network architecture with care.
- Train and validate all algorithms.
- Make the necessary assumptions.
