# 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks

In this task you are supposed to implement a convolutional neural network using a high level library, e.g. PyTorch. 
- The classification should be about food.

### Data Preparation:
- The dataset contains 11 food categories: Bread, Dairy product, Dessert, Egg, Fried food, Meat, Noodles/Pasta, Rice, Seafood, Soup, and Vegetable/Fruit.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. You may start with a subset of the dataset to speed up the initial experiments.
- Perform necessary pre-processing steps such as resizing the images, normalization, and data augmentation to make the dataset ready for training.

### Implement CNN Using a High-Level Library:
- Start by implementing simple standard convolutional neural networks such as LeNet or a shallow custom CNN architecture.
- Train the model using appropriate hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
- Use optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

### Experiment with More Complex Architectures:
- Once you are familiar with simpler architectures, experiment with deeper and more complex architectures such as VGG, ResNet, or custom CNN designs.
- Compare the performance of these complex networks against the simpler models.

### Evaluation and Performance Metrics:
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Analyze the confusion matrix to identify which food categories are difficult to classify.

### Compare Results:
- Compare the results of the different CNN architectures in terms of performance metrics and training time.
- Discuss the impact of model complexity on accuracy, speed, and overfitting.

###  Choose the network architecture with care.

###  Train and validate all algorithms.

### Make the necessary assumptions.
