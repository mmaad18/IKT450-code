# 6 - Recurrent Neural Networks

In this task you are supposed to implement a chatbot in two ways: 
1. As a classifier 
2. As generator

### Download the Dataset:

- Download the Python Questions from Stack Overflow dataset https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/pythonquestions 
 
### Requirements:

- Make the chatbot so that you classify a category (i.e., tag) of input text, and return a dialog from the correct class. 
  Note that one question could have multiple tags and you may need to simplify.
- Alternatively, make a sequence to sequence network that automatically learns what to respond. 
  It can be character based or word based.

### Hints:

- Start with a subset of the dataset. 
 
### Choose the network architecture with care.

### Train and validate all algorithms.

### Make the necessary assumptions.
