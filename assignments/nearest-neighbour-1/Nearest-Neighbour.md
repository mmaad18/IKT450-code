# 1 - Implement and Evaluate the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm from Scratch

In this task, you will implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using only Python, 
without the use of any machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. 
You will then evaluate the performance of your implementation using various metrics.

### Download the Dataset:
- Use the Pima Indian dataset, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kumargh/pimaindiansdiabetescsv.

### Implement the KNN Classifier:
Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch. Your implementation should include:
- Calculation of distances between points.
- Sorting of distances to identify the nearest neighbors.
- Voting mechanism to predict the class of a data point based on the classes of its nearest neighbors.

### Predict the Classes:
- Use your KNN implementation to predict the two classes in the Pima Indian dataset (diabetic or not diabetic).

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Experiment with different values of the hyperparameter K (number of neighbors) to determine the best fit for the model.
- Discuss how the choice of K affects the modelâ€™s performance. 

### Evaluate the Algorithm:
Evaluate the performance of your KNN implementation using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The average of the squares of the errors between the predicted and actual values.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A table that describes the performance of the classification model by 
  showing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
- **Accuracy and loss graph:** Add an accuracy and loss graph.


#### Choose the network architecture with care.

#### Train and validate all algorithms.
