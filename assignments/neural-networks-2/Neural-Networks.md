# 2 - Neural Networks

In this task you are supposed to implement 2 types of mulilayer Perceptrons: 
1. Using only Python. 
2. Using a high level library

- Download the Ecoli dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ecoli 
- Predict the two classes: cp and im (remove the rest of the dataset).
- Make the necessary adjustments to the data.
- Implement and test a Multilayer Perceptron from scratch using only Python and standard libraries (do not train this).
- Implement, train and test a Multilayer Perceptron using a high level library (e.g., Torch, Keras, TensorFlow).
- Choose the network architecture with care.
- Train and validate all algorithms.
- Make the necessary assumptions.
